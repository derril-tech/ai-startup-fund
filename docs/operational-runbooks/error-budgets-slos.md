# Error Budgets & SLOs - Operational Runbook

## Overview
This document defines the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Error Budgets for the AI Startup Fund platform to ensure reliable operation and user experience.

## Service Level Objectives (SLOs)

### 1. Pitch Ingestion SLOs
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Latency**: 95th percentile < 30 seconds for file upload
- **Success Rate**: 99.5% successful ingestions
- **Error Budget**: 0.1% (8.76 hours/month)

### 2. Valuation Engine SLOs
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime
- **Latency**: 95th percentile < 60 seconds for valuation calculation
- **Success Rate**: 99.0% successful valuations
- **Error Budget**: 0.5% (3.65 hours/month)

### 3. Panel Simulation SLOs
- **Availability**: 99.0% uptime
- **Latency**: 95th percentile < 120 seconds for panel completion
- **Success Rate**: 98.5% successful simulations
- **Error Budget**: 1.0% (7.3 hours/month)

### 4. Export Generation SLOs
- **Availability**: 99.8% uptime
- **Latency**: 95th percentile < 180 seconds for export generation
- **Success Rate**: 99.2% successful exports
- **Error Budget**: 0.2% (1.46 hours/month)

## Error Budget Tracking

### Monthly Error Budget Allocation
```
Total Monthly Hours: 730.5 hours
- Pitch Ingestion: 0.73 hours (0.1%)
- Valuation Engine: 3.65 hours (0.5%)
- Panel Simulation: 7.3 hours (1.0%)
- Export Generation: 1.46 hours (0.2%)
- Total Error Budget: 13.14 hours (1.8%)
```

### Error Budget Consumption Monitoring
- **Green Zone**: < 50% of budget consumed
- **Yellow Zone**: 50-80% of budget consumed
- **Red Zone**: > 80% of budget consumed

## Alerting Rules

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response Required)
- Service availability drops below 99%
- Error rate exceeds 5%
- Response time exceeds 95th percentile by 2x
- Database connection failures
- External API failures (OpenAI, etc.)

### Warning Alerts (Response within 1 hour)
- Error budget consumption > 80%
- Response time approaching SLO limits
- High memory/CPU usage
- Queue depth increasing

### Informational Alerts (Monitor and investigate)
- Error budget consumption > 50%
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Performance degradation trends

## Incident Response

### P1 - Critical Incident
- **Response Time**: < 15 minutes
- **Resolution Time**: < 2 hours
- **Escalation**: On-call engineer → Engineering Manager → CTO
- **Examples**: Complete service outage, data loss, security breach

### P2 - High Priority Incident
- **Response Time**: < 30 minutes
- **Resolution Time**: < 4 hours
- **Escalation**: On-call engineer → Engineering Manager
- **Examples**: Service degradation, high error rates

### P3 - Medium Priority Incident
- **Response Time**: < 2 hours
- **Resolution Time**: < 8 hours
- **Escalation**: On-call engineer
- **Examples**: Performance issues, feature bugs

### P4 - Low Priority Incident
- **Response Time**: < 24 hours
- **Resolution Time**: < 72 hours
- **Escalation**: None
- **Examples**: UI improvements, documentation updates

## Monitoring and Observability

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Application Metrics**
   - Request rate, error rate, response time
   - Database query performance
   - Cache hit rates
   - Queue depths

2. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - CPU, memory, disk usage
   - Network latency and throughput
   - Container health and restart rates

3. **Business Metrics**
   - User engagement (pitches created, valuations run)
   - Feature usage (panel simulations, exports)
   - Conversion rates

### Dashboards
- **Executive Dashboard**: High-level SLOs and business metrics
- **Engineering Dashboard**: Detailed technical metrics and error budgets
- **On-Call Dashboard**: Real-time alerts and incident status

## Post-Incident Process

### 1. Incident Response
- Acknowledge alert within SLA
- Assess impact and severity
- Implement immediate mitigation
- Communicate to stakeholders

### 2. Incident Resolution
- Root cause analysis
- Permanent fix implementation
- Verification of resolution
- Update monitoring/alerting if needed

### 3. Post-Mortem (P1/P2 incidents)
- Document timeline and actions taken
- Identify root cause and contributing factors
- Define action items and owners
- Schedule follow-up review

### 4. Error Budget Recovery
- Implement additional monitoring
- Add circuit breakers and fallbacks
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Update runbooks and procedures

## Continuous Improvement

### Monthly SLO Reviews
- Review error budget consumption
- Analyze incident patterns
- Update SLOs based on business needs
- Adjust alerting thresholds

### Quarterly SLO Planning
- Assess business impact of current SLOs
- Plan infrastructure improvements
- Update error budgets
- Review and update runbooks

## Tools and Automation

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Dashboards and visualization
- **Sentry**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- **PagerDuty**: Incident management and escalation

### Automation
- **Auto-scaling**: Based on CPU/memory usage
